Now your setup is complete, and you can begin using the project!

##  Execution 
We use the jupyter notebook to do the summary. Here are the steps:
1. Please go through the `perfeed/notebooks/weekly_summary.ipynb` notebook with the example.

2. In the root folder, run the command below and it would redirect you to the browser.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook perfeed/notebooks/weekly_summary.ipynb
   ```

   Or you can see the localhost in the terminal after running the cmd. Please paste the URL in the browser, and you can see the notebook.

3. Update the repo owner and the repo you want in the notebook via browser, and execute. 
   - Here's the way to find the Owner Repo, and the Author name. Here's the example PR URL: `https://github.com/Perfeed/perfeed/pull/29`
      - Owner: `Perfeed`
      - Repo: `perfeed` 
      - Author name: `jzxcd`
